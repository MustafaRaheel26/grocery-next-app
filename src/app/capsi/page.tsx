                Capsicum is a widely cultivated plant in the family Capsicaceae. It is a small, round, purple-green plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Capsicum is native to the Indian subcontinent, the Philippines, and Central Asia.
                Capsicum has a taste reminiscent of citrus fruits and is often used as a spice. It is also a popular vegetable in many Indian cuisines.
                The cure for some common diseases, such as cholera, influenza, and pneumonia, is derived from capsicum. Capsicum is also a popular ingredient in Indian desserts such as gulab jamun, mango gulab jamun, and rice gulab jamun.
